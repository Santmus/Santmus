## Personal interest:

First of all I like reading comics-books and surfing in the Internet. Twice a week I go to the hostel`s gym where I do different exercise on my back, shoulders and legs, because I want look more handsome and healthy. Secondly I very like driving a car, because I fell fresh and get adrenaline when I drive. Every day I walk the streets and listening music. And the same time I play computer or playstation 4 pro. I have many hoobies and interest and these are the key ones.

I think I`m a good speaker and even a better listener - that's why I have always been able to get along with different types of people. Nevertheless I can join the discussions and defend my point of view (positions) about technologies, patterns or models of development for programming.
